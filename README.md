# Game Description

## Game Style and Similar Games
The game we're crafting embraces a blend of dungeon-crawling adventure and medieval aesthetics, offering players an immersive single-player experience that unfolds within the depths of procedurally generated dungeons. Drawing inspiration from titles like "Darker and Darker," "Deep Rock Galactic," and "Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons," our game will present a distinctive blend of exploration, combat, and resource extraction intertwined with our overall aesthetic. 

## Game Mechanic
The core game mechanic in our single-player medieval-style dungeon crawler revolves around the cycle of exploration and progression. Players begin their journey equipped with basic gear and venture into procedurally generated dungeons, engaging in battles against various {- randomly spawning -} enemies  and uncovering  {- valuable loot -}  {+ better gear +} hidden within chests. The twist lies in their objective: to successfully extract themselves from the dungeon  {- with their newfound riches -}  {+ stronger than they went in +}. To do this, they must return to the entrance they started from, all while carefully managing their inventory and deciding which {- treasures -}  {+ gear +} to keep and which to leave behind. Outside of the dungeons, players have access to a stash where they can securely store their hard-earned loot. With each new run, {- random spawn locations and -} {+ the +} dungeon generation keeps the gameplay fresh, while enemy difficulty scales {- dynamically -} based on the player's gear{+.+}{-, ensuring a challenging experience -}. Additionally, a timer adds an element of urgency, challenging players to balance risk and reward as they aim to complete each level within a set time frame.

## Challenge Technologies
Our game development will involve tackling challenging engine technologies that are essential to the immersive experience we aim to provide. Firstly, procedural generation will be at the forefront of our technical challenges, as it forms the backbone of our dungeon creation system. This technology will require us to design algorithms that generate intricate, dynamic dungeon layouts, keeping gameplay fresh and engaging with each playthrough. 

Secondly, our endeavor into advanced enemy AI and general AI presents another layer of complexity. We're committed to crafting intelligent enemies that adapt to player actions and exhibit diverse behaviors, enhancing the overall gaming experience. 

These challenging technologies will not only push the boundaries of our development capabilities but also contribute significantly to the depth and replayability of our dungeon crawler.
