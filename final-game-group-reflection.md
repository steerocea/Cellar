# Final Game Group Reflection 

## Levi (Weapons):

After completing my section of the project I can say that I am happy with the result. I really enjoyed working with the weapons I created and found it a very valauble experience to be able to learn how to develop in unreal. I also found working with the animations to be a very educational experience. I am happy with how well my parts fit into the game as a whole and how well everything came together.

The group worked very well together throughout this assignment which may have been made easier due to only having 3 people for a 5-6 person group project. Due to timings with other assignments and exams some of the work was done a bit too close to the deadline especially for the first prototype. Some more time management especially from me would have given us more time to debug and test our game.

## Kent (Procedural / Dungeon Design):

After finishing my part of the final project I am very happy with how it turned out. My procedural system generates different and interesting dungeon designs, and was made in such a way where adding new room and hallway types is easy. I also stuck to the aesthetic of the prototype rooms with the dungeon, in both layout and lighting, and alongside the ambient sound I added, I think they work well together. 

As a group I think we worked better in the second half of the project over the first, both because of what we learnt from the beginning and the fact that we had more time for development. While there are many things I think could be improved in the final game, I'm happy with the progress each of us made in relation to the skill level we had going into it. I do think more polish and bug fixing would have helped before hand in however, as we ran into new issues near the end. 

## Ocean (UI / Inventory):

After completing the final touches on the project, I am very happy with what I and the rest of the group have been able to produce. Working with all different types of code and ways to approach problems throughout building up the UI and Inventory system has been a very fulfilling experience and has given me knowledge I will take on in future endeavors. 

Overall, as a group I think we worked well together, especially given the circumstances of only having 3 group members for a large project we took it in stride and were able to put out something we are all proud of. I believe we worked better and more efficiently as time went on, we got used to how each other works and on top of everything after completing other commitments were able to put more focus into this project improving our final outcome. We could have done for more hands in certain areas especially when it came to debugging and final polish so the last few days of rush were not so intense, but in the end, it has been a great learning experience and I am very grateful to of been able to produce this project alongside this great group of guys.
