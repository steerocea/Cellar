# Final Game Group Reflection 

## Levi (Weapons):


## Kent (Procedural / Dungeon Design):

After finishing my part of the final project I am very happy with how it turned out. My procedural system generates different and interesting dungeon designs, and was made in such a way where adding new room and hallway types is easy. I also stuck to the aesthetic of the prototype rooms with the dungeon, in both layout and lighting, and alongside the ambient sound I added, I think they work well together. 

As a group I think we worked better in the second half of the project over the first, both because of what we learnt from the beginning and the fact that we had more time for development. While there are many things I think could be improved in the final game, I'm happy with the progress each of us made in relation to the skill level we had going into it. I do think more polish and bug fixing would have helped before hand in however, as we ran into new issues near the end.
