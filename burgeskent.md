# Group Contribution:
## My Contribution To The Group / My Communication Role:

For this project I had the Wolf role, so my job was being the manager and keeping the group together. Since we didn't have a Bear in the group (An overall leader), for the most part that job was given to me. I think I did pretty well for my first time leading a group, I would keep up to date on my teammates work and provide ideas or motivation if needed. This included setting meeting times, and talking to each teammate individually about their progress. 

## Group Dynamics:

I think we worked decently well as a team, as we all would ask for help if needed and provide it as well. The discord helped greatly in our fast communication, and most of the time we were all online to assess any problems with the project. One of the only things I think we could improve on is time management, as in the first half of the project due to other uni work, both my teammates didn't work on the project until shortly before the prototype hand in.
Another problem that isn't our teams fault is just the lack of team members we had. Most teams had 5-6 people, but we had 3. This meant we had to scale down our project in either the size or quality to compensate for this, which I think we did effectively. One of the benefits however of a smaller team was easier communication, and less chance for GitLab pushing / pulling issues because of many people working in different areas.

## Parts Of The Project I Worked On:

Zombie Enemy:

Procedural Generation:
Since I had a little more Unreal Engine experience than my teammates before this project, and I wants interested in the topic, I wanted to take on the writing of the procedural generation code, which was by far the largest part of the game I worked on.
