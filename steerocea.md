# Group Contribution: 

## My Contribution To The Group / My Communication Role: 

My technical contribution to the group was mostly involved in working on and building the inventory systems along with implementing the majority of the UI features. This was an aspect fairly new to me as it wasn’t something I touched on in assignment 1 or my previous works. However, I felt I made a strong contribution and complimented my teammates' works well considering my work was essential for them to continue parts of theirs as well. 

 

My communication role inside the group was that of the puppy, meaning I was mainly focused on being the enthusiastic, eager member to help give the others an extra push and support with their ideas and work. Along with the positive attitude I believe I played a big role in ensuring that tasks were moving forward, deadlines were being met, and everyone was on the same page for the work that needed to be done.  

 

## Group Dynamics: 

Our group dynamics worked well I believe. Considering we had a smaller team it was very important for us to be on the same page and take accountability for the roles and work that has been assigned to us. These aspects fostered a collaborative and efficient work environment, ensuring that everyone could contribute effectively. 
 

# Code Discussion: 

## Parts Of The Project I Worked On: 

As touched on before, the parts of the project I worked on involved the inventory system and everything that is encased in that, as well as the UI features involved in the inventory and the wider game.    

### Inventory System – ALL 

### Game UI – MOST 

### Equip System / Player Stats – ALL 

### Player Health and Damage - MOST

## Most Interesting/Proudest Blueprint I Wrote: 

The most interesting blueprint I wrote is also the one that I am the most proud of, being the inventory system and also the different blueprints that implement this system. The main blueprint is a very robust blueprint serving as the backbone for all the actions taken regarding inventories and different items, with all of these different working parts combining them all together is something I am very proud of. 


Pictured below are some of the most essential features of the inventory system blueprint among the several important ones:

### Remove From Inventory

### Add to Inventory

### Transfer Slots

### Equip Item

### Create New Stack

### Interaction Trace

## My Worst Blueprint Code: 

My worst and most poorly written code is that of generating random item scores as well as the mouse detection from within the action menu. What makes these parts poor is how hard they are to understand due to the inclusion of many hard coded numbers, sprawling links everywhere on top of an already hard to grasp math equation.  

### Item Scores

### Mouse Detection

## My Use Of ChatGPT: 

My use of ChatGPT and other AI tools was very limited in this project, where the only parts it was used were for the formulas to generate random item scores on a curve where higher numbers are less likely to appear compared to the lower item scores. AI was very useful for this purpose; however, I would have liked to have utilized it better throughout my work, however, I didn’t find it as useful when working on blueprint code.  
 
# Learning Reflection: 

## What I Learnt From This Project: 

I have learned and developed as a programmer significantly through this project and I am very grateful for having the opportunity to do so. I had the opportunity to delve into new areas like inventory systems and UI design. This really taught me how much is involved in inventory and to not take it for granted. The many ways users can interact with it can lead to many different outcomes and you as the developer have to prepare for this. Also, through doing the UI design I have gained valuable in photoshop from editing, combining, and finding assets which is a very transferable skill I'm glad to have learned.  

On top of the technical skills, I learned the value of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving in a programming environment. In particular, just how useful and essential strong git knowledge is to ensure a smooth experience and limit the amount of overwriting and mistakes that take place.  
 
## Most Important Thing I Wil Use In Future Projects: 

One key takeaway from this project that I will carry into future endeavors is the importance of effective communication within a team. Being the "Puppy" taught me the significance of maintaining a positive attitude and supporting team members. I believe that fostering a collaborative work environment is vital for achieving project success. Also, building upon the aspect of working within a team the amount of git knowledge I have gained through the project is also something that is invaluable and something you don’t get working on solo projects which I am very thankful for.  

Additionally, I aim to continue improving my coding practices, focusing on writing cleaner and more maintainable code to avoid the pitfalls of hard-to-understand code sections I encountered in this project.
